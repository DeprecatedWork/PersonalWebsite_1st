This is my personal Resume website, and general plaything. A tool in which I try out
new front end things on. This repo contains the HTML, CSS form of the website. I 
plan to later build the same site later using MVC so that I can create my own
forms, API etc for practice.

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).

Since using the starting Bootstrap this website has been heavily edited (HTML and CSS)

Have tried to keep the css clean and well documented. Any questions, please ask.
